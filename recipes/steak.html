        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Flank steak is a lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's 
            lower abdominal muscles. It's a relatively tough cut that's 
            low in fat, which means a few things: Flank steak doesn't need to 
            be trimmed, it's inexpensive compared to other cuts, and it 
            benefits greatly from marination.
